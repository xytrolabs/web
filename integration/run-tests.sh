# Run the Playwright integration suite.
#
# Playwright's browser download host is often unreachable (and some host OSes
# aren't supported by the browser bundles), so the tests run inside the official
# Playwright container, which ships the browsers. The container uses host
# networking to reach the published stack ports (webmail :3000, Stalwart :8025).
#
# The docker stack itself is brought up here (on the host) and the in-container
# run is told to skip its own docker management via IT_NO_DOCKER=1.
#
# Usage:
#   integration/run-tests.sh                 # whole suite
#   integration/run-tests.sh 01-login        # a single spec (grep on file name)
#
# Env:
#   IT_VIDEO=on   record a video.webm for every test (not just failures);
#                 also: off | retain-on-failure (default) | on-first-retry.
#                 e.g. IT_VIDEO=on integration/run-tests.sh 01-login
