/**
 * Issue #569 — the composer's "From" dropdown should include identities from
 * shared/group accounts, not only the logged-in (connected) accounts.
 *
 * Scenario under test (the one expected to already work): a Stalwart *group*
 * mailbox `team@example.org` is provisioned and `carol` is made a member of it
 * *before her first login* (integration/stalwart/plan-accounts.ndjson.tpl +
 * entrypoint.sh). As a member she gets the group's shared folders (shown under
 * "Shared") and — per Stalwart — a `team@` send-as identity (Stalwart returns
 * it among the member's own account identities). The composer should therefore
 * offer `team@example.org` as a sender alongside her own address.
